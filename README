I. What is starcode?   
--------------------

Starcode is an exact and fast DNA sequence clustering software. Sequence
clustering is performed based on a Levenshtein distance metric [1].
Typically, a file containing a set of related DNA sequences is passed as
input, jointly with a parameter specifying the desired cluster distance.
Starcode aligns and computes the distance between all the sequence pairs
[2] and prints a line for each cluster containing: canonical DNA sequence,
sequence count and the list of sequences that belong to the cluster.

Starcode has many applications in the field of biology, such as DNA/RNA
motif recovery, barcode clustering, sequencing error recovery, etc.


II. Source file list

III. Compilation and installation
---------------------------------

To install starcode you first need to clone or manually download the 
repository content from github:

 > git clone git://github.com/gui11aume/starcode.git

the files should be downloaded in a folder named 'starcode'. To compile
just change the directory to 'starcode' and run make (Mac users require
'xcode', available at the Mac Appstore):

 > cd starcode
 > make

a binary file 'starcode' will be created. You can optionally make a
symbolic link to execute starcode from any directory:

 > sudo ln -s ./starcode /usr/bin/starcode


IV. Running starcode
--------------------

Starcode runs on Linux and Mac. It has not been tested on Windows.

List of arguments:

  starcode [options] {[-i] INPUT_FILE | -1 PAIRED_END_FILE1 -2 PAIRED_END_FILE2} [-o OUTPUT_FILE]

  -v or --verbose
     Verbose. Prints verbose information to the standard error channel.

  -d or --distance distance
     Defines the maximum Levenshtein distance for clustering.
     When not set it is automatically computed as:
     min(8, 2 + [median seq length]/20)

  -t or --threads threads
     Defines the maximum number of parallel threads.
     Default is 1.

  -s or --spheres
     When specified, sphere clustering algorithm is performed in the
     clustering phase, instead of the default message passing algorithm.

  -h or --help
     Prints usage information.

  -o or --output file
     Specifies output file. When not set, standard output is used instead.

  --non-redundant
     Removes redundant sequences from the output. Only the canonical sequence
     of each cluster is returned.


  Single-file mode:
  -i or --input file
     Specifies input file.

  Paired-end fastq files:
  -1 file1 -2 file2
     Specifies two paired-end FASTQ files for paired-end clustering mode.

  Standard input is used when neither -i nor -1/-2 are set.

V. File formats
---------------

V.I. Supported input file formats:

  V.I.I. Plain text:

    Consists of a file containing one sequence per line. Only the standard
    DNA-base characters are supported ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'). The sequences
    may not contain empty spaces at the beginning or the end of the string,
    as these will be counted as alignment characters. The file may not
    contain empty lines as these will be considered as zero-length sequences.
    The sequences do not need to be sorted and may be repeated.
   
    Example:
    TTACTATCGATCATCATCGACTGACTACG
    ACTGCATCGACTAGCTACGACTACGCTACCATCAG
    TTACTATCGATCATCATCGACTGACTAGC
    ACTACGACTACGACTCAGCTCACTATCAGC
    GCATCGACCGCTACTACGCATACTACGACATC


  V.I.II. Plain text with sequence count:

    If the count of the sequences is known, it may be specified in the input
    file using the following format:
      [SEQUENCE]\t[COUNT]\n

    Where '\t' denotes the TAB character and '\n' the NEWLINE character.
    The sequences do not need to be sorted and may be repeated as well. If
    a repeated sequence is found, their counts will be addded together. As
    before, the sequences may not contain any additional characters and the
    file may not contain empty lines.

    Example:
    TATCGACTCTATCTATCGCTGATGCGTAC       200
    CGAGCCGCCGGCACGTCACGACGCATCAA       1
    TAGCACCTACGCATCTCGACTATCACG         234
    CGAGCCGCCGGCACGTCACGACGCATCAA       17
    TGACTCTATCAGCTAC                    39

  V.I.III. FASTA/FASTQ

    Starcode supports FASTA and FASTQ files as well. Note, however, that
    starcode does not use the quality factors and the only relevant
    information is the sequence itself. The FASTA/FASTQ labels will not
    be used to identify the sequences in the output file. The sequences do
    not need to be sorted and may be repeated.

    Example FASTA:
    > FASTA sequence 1 label
    ATGCATCGATCACTCATCAGCTACAG
    > FASTA sequence 2 label
    TATCGACTATCTACGACTACATCA
    > FASTA sequence 3 label
    ATCATCACTCTAGCAGCGTACTCGCA
    > FASTA sequence 4 label
    ATGCATCGATTACTCATCAGCTACAG

    Example FASTQ:
    @ FASTQ sequence 1 label
    CATCGAGCAGCTATGCAGCTACGAGT
    +
    -$#'%-#.&)%#)"".)--'*()$)%
    @ FASTQ sequence 2 label
    TACTGCTGATATTCAGCTCACACC
    +
    ,*#%+#&*$-#,''+*)'&.,).,


V.II. Output format:

  V.II.I Standatd output format:

    Starcode prints a line for each detected cluster with the following
    format:

    [CANONICAL SEQUENCE]\t[CLUSTER SIZE]\t[CLUSTER SEQUENCES]\n
  
    Where '\t' denotes the TAB character and '\n' the NEWLINE character.
    'CANONICAL SEQUENCE' is the sequence of the cluster that has more
    counts, 'CLUSTER SIZE' is the aggregated count of all the sequences
    that form the cluster, and 'CLUSTER SEQUENCES' is a list of all the
    cluster sequences separated by commas and in arbitrary order. The
    lines are printed sorted by 'CLUSTER SIZE' in descending order.

    For instance, an execution with the following input and clustering
    distance of 3 (-d3):

    TAGCTAGACGTA   250
    TAGCTAGCCGTA   10
    TAAGCTAGGGGT   16
    ACGCGAGCGGAA   155
    ACTTTAGCGGAA   1

    would produce the following output:

    TAGCTAGACGTA    276       TAGCTAGACGTA,TAGCTAGCCGTA,TAAGCTAGGGGT
    ACGCGAGCGGAA    156       ACGCGAGCGGAA,ACTTTAGCGGAA

    The same example executed with a more restrictive distance -d2 would
    produce the following output:

    TAGCTAGACGTA    260       TAGCTAGACGTA,TAGCTAGCCGTA
    ACGCGAGCGGAA    155       ACGCGAGCGGAA
    TAAGCTAGGGGT    16        TAAGCTAGGGGT
    ACTTTAGCGGAA    1         ACTTTAGCGGAA

  V.II.II Non-redundant output format:

    In non-redundant output mode, starcode only prints the canonical
    sequence of each cluster, one per line. Following the example from
    the previous section, the output with distance 3 (-d3) would be:

    TAGCTAGACGTA
    ACGCGAGCGGAA
    
    whereas for -d2:

    TAGCTAGACGTA
    ACGCGAGCGGAA
    TAAGCTAGGGGT
    ACTTTAGCGGAA
